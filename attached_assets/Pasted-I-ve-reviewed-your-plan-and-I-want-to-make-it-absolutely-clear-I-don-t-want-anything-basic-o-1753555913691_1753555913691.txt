I‚Äôve reviewed your plan and I want to make it absolutely clear:

‚ùå I don‚Äôt want anything ‚Äúbasic‚Äù or minimal.
‚úÖ I want every system in the **initial version** to be built at the highest possible level ‚Äî as if it‚Äôs a production-grade security tool ready for professional Bug Bounty hunting.

That means:
‚Ä¢ Subdomain enumeration must include brute-force, DNSSEC, wildcard detection, API integrations (like Censys, Shodan), multithreading, and caching.
‚Ä¢ Endpoint discovery must include robots.txt, sitemap.xml, JS analysis, Wayback Machine scraping, and store results in JSON/CSV with deduplication.
‚Ä¢ Fingerprinting must detect technologies deeply (headers, bodies, Wappalyzer-like detection), WAF/CDN identification, SSL/TLS analysis, and stack fingerprints.
‚Ä¢ Vulnerability scanning must cover XSS (reflected, stored, DOM), SQLi (union, blind, error-based), open redirects, CORS misconfigurations, path traversal/LFI/RFI, host header injection, JWT flaws, etc., with safe test payloads, concurrency, and intelligent retry logic.
‚Ä¢ AI modules must be included from the start:
  ‚Äì AI triage engine for severity classification,
  ‚Äì AI payload generator,
  ‚Äì AI false-positive filtering,
  ‚Äì AI-driven report writing.
‚Ä¢ Reporting must generate rich HTML, JSON, and CSV with screenshots, risk scoring, timeline, and a clear summary for HackerOne-style submissions.
‚Ä¢ CLI must be advanced: tab-completion, colored output, clear logging, profile management, environment detection (Kali), and helpful commands (scan, report, export, triage, plugins, help).
‚Ä¢ All modules must be designed with plugin-style architecture to allow future extension.
‚Ä¢ Use best practices: parallel execution, caching layers, proxy/TOR support, error handling with retries, and full documentation.

üëâ Build all of this directly in the initial version ‚Äî nothing minimal, nothing basic.  
üëâ Choose the best languages per module (Go, Rust, Python, etc.) and integrate them into one cohesive project runnable on Kali Linux.

If you think of additional modules or advanced ideas beyond what I described, ask me first before adding.

I expect you to produce real, working code for eve
