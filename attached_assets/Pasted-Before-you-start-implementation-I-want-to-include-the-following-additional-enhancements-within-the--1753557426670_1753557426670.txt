Before you start implementation, I want to include the following additional enhancements within the current web security scope:

✅ Authentication Bruteforce Tester
• Controlled testing using safe test accounts
• Analyze rate-limiting behavior on login endpoints
• Report any lack of brute-force protection

✅ Headers Security Suggestions
• Go beyond detection and provide actionable configuration advice (CSP, HSTS, SameSite, etc.) in the report

✅ Automated Retest
• A feature to rerun tests specifically on previously found vulnerabilities to verify if they have been fixed

✅ Cross-scan Comparison
• Ability to compare two scan results and highlight what is new, what has been fixed, and what remains

✅ Scheduler Engine
• Allow scans to be scheduled (e.g. run every week at a specific time)

✅ Enhanced Caching
• Support for Redis or SQLite-based caching for persistence and performance improvements across scans

✅ Fallback Redundancy
• If a server or proxy fails, automatically retry via another proxy or port

✅ Rate-Limit Detection on All Endpoints
• Check not only login but also critical API endpoints for rate-limiting issues
• Identify endpoints vulnerable to brute-force or scraping

✅ Hidden Route and Legacy Endpoint Discovery
• Analyze JS and Wayback data to find hidden routes or older API versions still accessible

✅ Content Security Analyzer
• Scan for sensitive data leakage in headers, bodies, or metadata (API keys, tokens, debug info)

✅ Chained Vulnerability Simulation
• Attempt to chain multiple found vulnerabilities to see if combined exploitation leads to higher impact

✅ Business-Context Prioritization
• Allow defining priority for targets (e.g., main domain vs. staging) to rank risks accordingly

✅ Adaptive Scanning
• Dynamically adjust scan depth and request rate based on server responses and potential detection

✅ Built-in PoC Generators per Vulnerability
• For each confirmed vulnerability, provide ready-to-use PoC code (e.g., XSS HTML snippet, SQLi payload)

✅ Intelligent Wordlist Expansion
• Automatically enrich wordlists during brute-force enumeration based on patterns found during scans

✅ Threat Intelligence Integration
• Correlate findings with live threat feeds to highlight known compromised assets or suspicious infrastructure

Please confirm you can add all of these enhancements before starting implementation.
