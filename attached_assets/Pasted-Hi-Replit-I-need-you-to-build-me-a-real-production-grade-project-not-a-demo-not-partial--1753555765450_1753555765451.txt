Hi Replit,

I need you to build me a **real, production‚Äëgrade project** ‚Äì not a demo, not partial code ‚Äì  
a fully working project that can run on Kali Linux as a complete ultimate Bug Bounty tool.  
It must have a smart and fast CLI and act like a full professional Red Team in one tool.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
- Do NOT generate placeholders or sample code.
- Every system/module you implement must be truly functional and executable.
- If you think of extra modules or ideas beyond what I list here, **ask me first** before adding them so I can approve.

---

üîπ **General guidelines**
- You choose the best programming languages for each part (for example: Go for the core scanning and CLI, Python for AI modules, Rust or C for high‚Äëperformance modules, etc.).
- You decide the best folder and file structure, but it must include **all of the following systems**.
- Each system should be in its own module or set of modules, with clean APIs between them.
- Everything must be designed to run perfectly on Kali Linux.

üìå **Your tasks:**
- Build a complete project with a folder/file structure that makes sense for these modules.
- Implement every system listed above to actually work, not just placeholders.
- Use the best languages for each part (Go, Rust, Python, etc.) and integrate them into one CLI tool that runs on Kali Linux.
- Ask me if you have new ideas before adding them.
- Make sure the code is clean, documented, and maintainable.

When you‚Äôre done, I should be able to:
- Clone or download the project,
- Install dependencies,
- Run a single CLI command,
- And start scanning targets with all these capabilities.

Thank you! Let me know if you have questions or extra ideas before implementing.
