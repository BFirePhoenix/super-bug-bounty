🔥 Ultimate Bug Bounty Tool
AI‑Powered Recon & Scanning Framework for Kali Linux

🚀 A next‑generation bug bounty & penetration testing tool that helps you find, analyze, and report security vulnerabilities like a pro.
It’s built for Kali Linux, modular, fast, and smart – combining AI analysis, deep reconnaissance, and advanced vulnerability scanning in one powerful CLI tool.

✨ Key Features
✅ Advanced Reconnaissance – Subdomains, endpoints, fingerprinting, WAF/CDN detection
✅ AI‑Powered Analysis – Smart triage, false‑positive filtering, and payload generation
✅ Vulnerability Scanning – XSS, SQLi, SSRF, CORS, RCE and more
✅ Smart Reporting – Beautiful HTML/JSON/CSV reports with executive summaries
✅ Automation & Scheduling – Set scans to run weekly or on demand
✅ Plugin‑Ready Architecture – Easily extend with custom modules
✅ Stealth & Performance – Proxy/TOR, caching (Redis/SQLite), adaptive rate‑limiting
✅ Extra Pro Features:

🔑 Brute‑force login testing (safe & controlled)

🔎 Hidden route discovery (JS & historical data)

🧭 Cross‑scan comparison (see what changed)

🛡️ Header security suggestions (CSP, HSTS, SameSite)

⚡ Chained vulnerability simulation (multi‑vector attack paths)

💻 How to Use
bash
Copy
Edit
# Run a full scan on a target
./yourtool scan example.com

# Generate a detailed report
./yourtool report <scan-id>

# Compare two scans
./yourtool compare <scan1-id> <scan2-id>
👉 Full usage examples are in the documentation.

🏗️ Architecture
🔧 Modular design: each component (recon, scanner, AI, reports) is independent but works together seamlessly.
🧑‍💻 Multi‑language: Go for core scanning, Python for AI, and other high‑performance components.
🔌 Plugin system: drop in new modules without changing the core.

🚀 Built for
✅ Bug bounty hunters

✅ Pen testers

✅ Security researchers

✅ Red Teamers who want automation + AI smarts
